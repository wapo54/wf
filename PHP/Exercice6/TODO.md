# Exercise 6

To create an easter egg, your dev leader create a function that shuffle a file. You find this easter egg 
really dangerous because no rollback can be done.

You decide to create a function called "easterReverse" that take a file path as argument, to reverse 
the second half part of the file.

Tips : Use "floor(strlen($fileContent) / 2)" to calculate the middle of the file.
Warning : you are not allowed to use "file_put_contents", "w" or "w+" access mode.

To validate it, just cd into the Exercice6 folder and run "php phpunit-6.5.5.phar".
