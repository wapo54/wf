# Exercise 7

You must create a function called "divide" that take in first parameter 
an integer to divide, and in second parameter, the divisor. 
If the divisor is zero, you must throw a RuntimeException.

You must create a second function called "arrayDivide" that 
take in first parameter an array of value to divide, and in 
second parameter, the divisor. If the divisor is zero, you must 
catch the exception and return the array of value, as it.
