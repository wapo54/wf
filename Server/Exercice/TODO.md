# Exercice 1

In this exercice, we need to create the home-page of the TagBeSill project.

You must use the "fixture.sql" file to create the testing data.

The test will need some dependencies. So you are expected to install them with 
composer.

Test case :
 * You must create a well formed html page
 * You must load the records from the database
 * Foreach record :
 	* The record image must be displayed into the html
 	* The record title must be displayed into the html
 	* The record description must be displayed into the html

To validate it, just cd into the exercice folder and run "php phpunit-6.5.5.phar".
